## Features And Function

![Features on main page](src/images/screenshots/main-page-features.png)

Here you can see a screenshot of our main page and some features that we integrated into our code.
When you first load the page, you will be greeted with a list of the most popular movies. If you search for a movie through the searchbar you will receive a list of movies with your keywords and below that the popular movies.

In the top right corner you can find the navigation bar with HOME, FAVORITES, ABOUT.
The 'home' button leads to the main page, the 'favorites' button leads to a list of your favorited movies (see picture below), the 'about' button leads to our about page with a short overview of information about the website and our team.

### Movie Poster Function

When you click on a movie, it will open up a new page with a detailed movie description. You will also be given a short summary of what the movie is about.

On the main page you can browse through the movies, you can set all movies as watched and that information will be saved into a local database. As well as the user rating, which you can set by clicking on the amount of stars you want to give the movie, upon click the stars given will turn yellow.
By clicking the heart button you save the selected movie into your favorites list, the heart will now be red.

### Favorite Movies Page

Clicking on the red heart will remove the movie from your favorite list.

## Where the idea came from

Roman was the one who suggested it and we all really liked it. He showed us this ![Example](https://dnotrad.github.io/movies/#/trends) and found this ![API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## Final Thoughts

This project was our very first group project, we had in total only 3.5 days to get finalize our work. For us it was a great practice, we gained a lot of experience and we felt that it was very nice to work together in a team.
We hope you like the result, it's the accumulation of our hard work (incl. some extra hours by our developers).
